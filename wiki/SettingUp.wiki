=Setting Up Shumvc=

==1. Obtaining the source==
Currently there is no stable release of shumvc. But the source a available from the svn trunk. You should know how this works ;)

The source currently contains a helloworld app which I use for simple test purposes.

As soon as a stable release is available for download I will update this wiki.

==2. Setting up your webserver==
A basic webserver will do fine. Make sure apache's mod_rewrite is enabled and the virtual host points to the www folder.

==3. Configuring Shumvc==
Setting up is easy, just make sure you properly configure the config.php file within the config directory. Also make sure the template_c folder in the app folder has rwx attributes for all users. (chmod 777)

Important is the DEPLOYMENT_URL. If you decided to let your vhost point to the shumvc folder instead of the web folder the index if found on /web/index.php so your DEPLOYMENT_URL should be /web/.
